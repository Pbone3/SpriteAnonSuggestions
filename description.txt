Most of the art and all the concepts and ideas for this mod originate from Sprite Anon's suggestion thread. I only programmed them in and added art when needed.

There's a thread on the Terraria forums, https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/weapon-accessory-ideas.29005/, that's the source of many ideas used by mods over the years such as Zoaklen or Spirit.
Terraria's had a lot of suggestions but this thread stuck with me, so I decided to add all of it's suggestions to the game.
